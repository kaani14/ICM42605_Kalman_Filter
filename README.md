# ICM42605_Kalman_Filter

# Description

The project interfaces ICM-42605 with STM32G474CET6. To fuse the data data from gyroscope and accelerometer, Kalman filter has been implemented.

# Includes:

 ICM42605.h: Configuring ICM42605, reading accelerometer and gyroscope data, computing orientation from the accelerometer and angular velocity from the gyroscope.
 
 Kalman.h: Kamlan Filter implementation, computation of a running variance
 
 Matrix_math.h: Operator overloading for operations in Kalman.cpp.
 
 # Kalman Filter Parameters
 
* Process noise covariance matrix (Q)= {{0.005, 0}, {0, 0.005}};

* State transition matrix (A) = {{1, 0}, {0, 1}};

* Control input matrix, time constant (B) = {{0.004, 0}, {0, 0.004}};

* Initial value (x_e) = {{10, 0}, {0, 10}};

* State error variance (p_e) = {{0.10, 0}, {0, 0.10}};

* Measurement Matrix(H) = {{1, 0}, {0, 1}};

* Measurement noise matrix (R) = {{Running variance of the last 100 values of pitch, 0},{0, Running variance of the last 100 values of Roll}}

# Results

**Noise Evaluation  of Roll:**

* Standard deviation of accelerometer when computing roll: 5.02째

* Standard deviation of accelerometer when computing roll: 3.05째 

**Noise Evaluation of Roll:**

* Standard deviation of accelerometer when computing pitch: 5.29째

* Standard deviation of accelerometer when computing pitch: 3.52째
